# BuildForCOVID19 Platform

BuildForCOVID19 Platform is built for #BuildforCOVID19 Global Online Hackathon organised by WHO, scientists at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub & other leading tech partners. The hackathon is open to all developers & companies and platforms including AWS, Facebook, Giphy, Microsoft, Pinterest, Salesforce, Slack, TikTok, Twitter and WeChat.

As the Corona Virus pandemic grows very rapidly and almost all major countries are now the victims of this pandemic, hence it also raises several problems infront of government, hospitals and local and global NGOs. This platform helps Users, hospitals, government, food partners and NGO to be in syncs so that helps can be extended out to needy at earliest.

This project solves 4 major issues through its integrated platform -

1. It's create a hyper conection among users. After signup, users can create their full profile on the platform. They can request free meal if there is shortage of meals at their houses. As user request meals request, the request goes to all the local user, gov, ngo and food partner. Hence, it helps to feed people while staying in isolation.

2. By creation of account, hospitals can raise request for ventilators. The raised requests along with complete profile of hospital will be shared with associated ventilators partner and government.

3. Through this integrated platform, users can easily donate money to fight against Corona Pandemic.

4. Users can also ask for medical help and even request for medical help on immediate basis if they are getting any corona symptoms.

Some comments:

1. As this whole project is built in 2 days. Hence, it lacks some advanced features. Platform is not mobile ready as all the css is natively written except a few.
2. Endpoints of API is completely ready. Some of the changes stills requires for adding some advance features like payment.
3. Whole front-end is written in Vanilla Javacript, hence here exists to move it to react.js and bring the redux for better state managent.

The major technolgies used are node.js, express, mongoDB and mongoose. There are some other tools and library is also included but not naming it here.
